## Background
The purpose of this project is to analyze the CSV data provided and conduct a report that uncovers demographic trends and preferences for the fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli.  Python with Pandas (through Jupyter Notebooks) was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

## Requirements

The report requires a breakdown of the following:

* Player Count
* Purchasing Analysis Total
* Gender Demographics
* Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
* Age Demographics
* Top Spenders
* Most Popular Items
* Most Profitable Items

## **This Homework has the following outputs:**

### **1.  Heroes of Pymoli - Jupyter Notebook**

This [file](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Pandas-Heroes-of-Pymoli/blob/master/Heroes%20of%20Pymoli/HerosOfPymoli.ipynb) provides the program to extract all the data by the following dataframes that will be useful in implementing new buisness strategies for the gaming company.

*    Total Players
*    Purchase Analysis (Total)
*    Gender Demographics
*    Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
*    Age Demographics
*    Purchasing Analysis (Age)
*    Top Spenders
*    Most Popular Items
*    Most Profitable Items

The data frame is extracted from the [CSV File](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Pandas-Heroes-of-Pymoli/blob/master/Heroes%20of%20Pymoli/Resources/HeroesOfPymoli_Purchase_Data.csv) saved in the [Resources](https://github.com/cecileung1208/Pandas-Heroes-of-Pymoli/tree/master/Heroes%20of%20Pymoli/Resources) directory.


### **2.  Heroes of Pymoli - Trends**
Based on the analysis from the Dataframes created in the Jupyter Notebook file, a report on the major trends have been documented.
